# CS_370_Emerging_Trends_In_CS

Analyze the role of ethics in current trends within the field as well as apply fundamental concepts of the field to
solve complex problems in new ways.

# Project

Treasure Hunt Game is a pathfinding AI project that I worked on in this course. The objective of the game is a player needs to find the treasure before the AI pirate agent does. Using a deep Q-learning algorithm, the pirate learns the optimal way to find the treasure from any position on the map.

# Code

I was given the code in the files GameExperience.py, TreasureMaze.py, and TreasureHuntGame.ipynb. I needed to complete the implementation of the Q-training algorithm code block. The goal of my deep Q-learning implementation is to find the best possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the trasure cell while maximizing the reward. 

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

A computer scientist understands the theoretical aspects of working with computers. They do not necessarily work with hardware and applications in the same way that computer engineers do. Instead, a computer scientist considers how technology handles information then applies it to programs.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The way I approach a problem as a computer scientist is to first understand how a human solves a problem. Next, understand how to translate this algorithm into something a computer can do. Finally, how to write the specific syntax to get the job done.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

One of the most important ethical concerns I learned about in this course regards hidden bias in AI. Any AI system can have biases injected into it and can harm our society without us aware being aware of it. As a developer of machine learning, I need to be aware of my own biases and attempt to design systems that are not inherently biased.
